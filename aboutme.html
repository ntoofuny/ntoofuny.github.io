				<p>
					I am currently a student at Queen's University working towards my BaSc. of Applied Science in Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in Mississauga, Ontario.
					Though I haven't painted for a few years now, I used to make a lot of art and so have attached a few of my pieces below for those interested. I love doing drawing inspiration from music, art and 
					nature and this has immensely helped my personal growth.
